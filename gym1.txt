Corporate Fitness
Executive Summary
Corporate Fitness will serve Seattle-area businesses, helping them to become more productive, while lowering their overall costs.

Our business is based on two simple facts:

Healthy employees are more productive than chronically ill employees.
It costs less to prevent injuries or illnesses than to treat them after they occur.
At Corporate Fitness, we tie worker productivity directly to the health care issue. We believe that traditional approaches to the current health care crisis are misdirected. These traditional efforts are what we call reactive–that is, they wait until after the worker has been stricken with illness or injury, and then pay for the necessary treatments. Our approach, which emphasizes prevention and good health promotion, is much more proactive.

By helping employees change their behavior patterns and choose more healthy lifestyles, Corporate Fitness will lower companies’ health care expenditures, while raising worker productivity. Health care expenditures will decrease due to reduced medical insurance premiums, reduced absenteeism, reduced turnover rates, reduced worker’s compensation claims, reduced tardiness, shorter hospital stays, etc.

The state of America’s health care crisis, coupled with current demographic changes, threaten to not only exacerbate the crisis, but further erode worker productivity as well. These environmental factors coupled with the local competitive situation signal a favorable opportunity in this market. We feel the time is right for Corporate Fitness.

2.3 Company Locations and Facilities

Services
Business ratios for Corporate Fitness indicate strong financial growth and an impressive chance for investment opportunities, making expansion and further development both very possible.

3.1 Service Description
Corporate Fitness provides wellness strategies/programs to businesses in the downtown Seattle area. A wellness strategy is a long-term effort, combining both health-promotion and exercise-related activities designed to facilitate positive lifestyle changes in members of a company’s work force.

Corporate Fitness will work with a company’s senior management to help it develop a mission statement for its wellness program. The client company’s employees will undergo a health-risk analysis, following which each employee will be given the opportunity to meet with a health professional to design a personalized health program.

Finally, Corporate Fitness will furnish employee progress reports to senior management with which to carry out the incentive program and generally monitor changes in the behavior of its work force.

3.2 Competitive Comparison
Corporate Fitness is not primarily a health club, as are the majority of competitors. This organization is in the business of health care cost management. The major function is to work with client companies to implement wellness strategies. Many employees will become benefactors of such strategies without ever visiting the fitness facility, as exercise is only one facet of overall wellness.

Corporate Fitness has a vested interest in each individual member of every wellness program, unlike many competitors. An integral part of this service is following up and monitoring the individuals.

3.3 Fulfillment
All fitness machines are purchased from exercise equipment distributors, while all medical equipment is bought from a reputable supply company.

Market Analysis Summary
In 1991, the U.S. medical bill was $738 million, of which businesses paid 30 percent. Recent studies indicate returns on investments in wellness programs for various companies ranging from $1.91:1 to $5.78:1. General Electric’s aircraft engines division, for example, saves $1 million per year through its wellness programs. Traveler’s Insurance Company reported savings of $7.8 million in 1991, attributable to its wellness programs, and a return of $3.41 for every dollar invested in wellness.

Important demographic changes are taking place in America that point to the importance of worker productivity in coming decades.

16 million new jobs will be created by the year 2000, but there will only be 14 million workers to fill them.
By 1995, women will comprise one-third of the work force, a ratio that will increase to one-half by the year 2000.
An estimated 80 percent of jobs to be filled in the immediate future will require more than a high-school education. Only 74 percent of Americans, however, finish high school, and only 67 percent graduate with adequate skills.
The number of skilled workers available to fill new jobs is decreasing, meaning that employers are facing more severe competition for labor. Thus, the health and productivity of each employee becomes crucial to a company’s success.
4.1 Market Segmentation
The market for corporate fitness is not particularly segmented, as potential customers include all downtown businesses that offer their employees some type of medical benefits, are experiencing escalating health care costs, and wish to more effectively manage those costs.

Corporate Fitness, however, segments its services for individual organizations. Corporate Fitness works with senior management to develop mission statements and provide incentive plans, and with employees to design personalized health and fitness programs.

4.2 Service Business Analysis
Several small fitness facilities are currently in operation in the downtown area, none of which cater their services to corporations. These organizations are primarily exercise facilities with little emphasis on personalizing individual plans to improve working performance.


4.2.1 Main Competitors
The three main competitors for Corporate Fitness are:

YMCA-market is lower-income families and/or students who want accessibility and affordability of fitness facilities.
Gold’s Gym-services are targeted toward those motivated and dedicated individuals who workout five to seven times per week.
Better Bodies-aimed at casual fitness-seekers who do not workout with a high intensity but still desire the status and recognition.
4.2.2 Distributing a Service
Few fitness centers are located in the downtown Seattle area, while the majority are found in suburban neighborhoods and shopping complexes. Those in the downtown area are located close to professional centers containing restaurants, parks, and other recreational activities. In suburban locales, these establishments are often found close to grocery stores, restaurants, and retail stores.

4.2.3 Business Participants
Participants in the fitness industry include national, regional, and local organizations. On the national level, companies such as Gold’s Gym and the YMCA offer exercise facilities and training programs. At the regional level, firms such as Better Bodies and Bally’s offer comparable services, while locally, privately-owned businesses provide similar, but less extensive services to exercise-seekers.

Strategy and Implementation Summary
Corporate Fitness’ strategy is based on raising worker productivity and lowering overall costs for businesses. The most logical way to approach these factors is through a healthy work force. Companies that implement wellness programs with Corporate Fitness will be encouraged to look at the “big picture” regarding the effects of its wellness programs. Thus, one marketing goal is to persuade more traditionally managed companies that wellness can work for them.

By tailoring services and developing customized programs for companies and individual employees, Corporate Fitness will develop a reputation for quality and customer service.

5.2 Marketing Strategy
Corporate Fitness will begin by targeting small- to medium-sized businesses in the downtown Seattle area. The first task is to convince senior executives of the benefits and needs of wellness programs. This will be accomplished by aggressively pursuing interaction and relationships with business professionals who would profit from using this service. Once a strong image is established, Corporate Fitness will use similar strategies to market its services to larger corporations in Seattle and other areas of expansion.

5.2.1 Pricing Strategy
Prices for using Corporate Fitness’ services are comparable to those of higher-end fitness centers. An employee choosing to utilize a Corporate Fitness center will pay a $100 monthly fee. For each employee enrolled in the general wellness program, regardless of whether or not they use the fitness facility, the employer will pay $150 annually. The prices reflect the quality of the equipment and service.

5.2.2 Promotion Strategy
Following initial promotional activity through advertisements in newspapers, magazines, and on television and radio, Corporate Fitness will significantly reduce its promotional efforts in the hope that word-of-mouth will attract potential clients. Promotional activity will still be utilized through these media outlets, but only minimally.

5.3 Sales Strategy

Financial Plan
Consulting revenue will make up approximately 85 to 90 percent of total revenue, with the rest coming from service revenue.
Salaries and rent are the two major expenses, while depreciation is another significant cost. Although the purchasing of fitness, medical, and office equipment is expensive, constant replacement will be needed to maintain a competitive edge.
In order to maintain steady gross margins, salaries and advertising expenses are not likely to increase within the first two years of operation, unless cash flows significantly increase.
7.1 Important Assumptions
Three assumptions for Corporate Fitness are:

A constantly growing economy without any major recession or boom.
No unpredictable changes in fitness, medical, or office equipment.
No major national or global events that threaten the stability and health of the country and its citizens.
